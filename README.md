Golang POSIX.1e ACL bindings.
Essentially bindings to /usr/include/sys/acl.h

The IEEE POSIX.1e specification describes five security extensions to the base
POSIX.1 API: Access Control Lists (ACLs), Auditing, Capabilities,
Mandatory Access Control, and Information Flow Labels.
The specificaiton was abandoned before finalization, however most
UNIX-like operating systems have some form of ACL implementation.
